Another way is to provide it as a static resource from the gerrit server.\nTo me it\u0027s not clear that packaging the icon with the plugin would be the normal case.",

      "message": "Hmm, maybe this is true for plugins that only link to another system. I\u0027m at the moment working on this \"Wiki\"-plugin and it add as project link that points to the readme of the project [1]. It would be nice to have an icon for this link, but at the moment I can\u0027t figure out how to provide this icon within the plugin as static resource.. This is why I was hoping to find an example for this here in the cookbook plugin ;-)\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/59913",
